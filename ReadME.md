The lab is split into 4 main parts.

**Part 1:**

  * Creating the hypergraph object 
  * Understand how to work with hypergraph-structure data
  * Building a basic HNN for node-level prediction
    
**Part 2:**

* Comparing hypergraph methods to graph based methods

**Part 3:**

* Creating mini-batches for hypergraphs
* Hypergraphs for graph-level prediction

**Part 4:**

* Hypergraph attention networks
