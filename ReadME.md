## Tutorial on Hypergraph Neural Network 


This lab is designed to showcase and familiarise you with the basics of learning on hypergraphs. It will encompass both the theory behind hypergraph networks and putting them into practice.

The lab is split into 4 main parts.

**Part 1:**

  * Creating the hypergraph object 
  * Understand how to work with hypergraph-structure data
  * Building a basic HNN for node-level prediction
    
**Part 2:**

* Comparing hypergraph methods to graph based methods

**Part 3:**

* Creating mini-batches for hypergraphs
* Hypergraphs for graph-level prediction

**Part 4:**

* Hypergraph attention networks
